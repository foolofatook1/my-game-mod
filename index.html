    <h3>
      Gameplay
    </h3>

    <p>
      <i>The player with the most hair growing out of their head goes first. (facial hair does not count!)</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i><b>On your turn</b> draw one card from the deck. <u><b>Do not look at it!</b></u> Deciding what to do next is mainly up to you. Your choices consist of:
        <ul>
          <li>Doing nothing (you can save that card for later!)</li>
          <li>Moving</li>
          <li>Battling</li>
        </ul>
      </i>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Movement
    </h3>

    <p>
      <i>Every card is a <b>Movement Card</b> worth the number of blocks displayed on it. To move, flip the top card of your own pile face up and move the respective number of spaces as blocks on the card, then discard. You are free to follow any path <u><b>displayed</b></u> on the board. You may do this until your pile is fully discarded.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Battle
    </h3>

    <p>
      <i>Though every card is a movement card, <b>not</b> every card is an <b>Attack Card</b>. Specifically, <p5>purple</p5> and <p6>orange</p6> cards are movement cards alone.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><i>The rules of battle are as follows:</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i><p2>Blue</p2>&gt;<p1>Red</p1>&gt;<p3>Green</p3>&gt;<p4>Yellow</p4></i>
    </p>

    <p>
     <i> <b>or</b>:<p2>Water</p2>beats<p1>Fire</p1>beats<p3>Grass</p3>beats<p4>Sand</p4>
      </i> </p>
    (A <p2>blue</p2> card beats the <p1>red(fire)</p1> warrior.)
    <p>
      <i> Battle begins when you and your opponent have landed on the same space. The player who initiates the battle goes second (i.e. the player on the space second goes second).</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>The players then proceed to flip their remaining stack of cards face up until one player flips a winning card. The losing player is out of the game and hands their kingdom card to the victor.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>If both characters run out of cards to flip, they may then take turns flipping cards from the main deck.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>If the main deck becomes empty at any point in the game, shuffle and use the discard pile. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>If their is no discard pile, players must move.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Win Condition
    </h3>

    <p>
      <i>The last remaining player/the player with the most Kingdom Cards is the winner!</i>
